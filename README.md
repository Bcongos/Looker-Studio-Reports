## Application of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques in Coal Quality Analysis
To categorize coal quality based on ash content and thickness measurements, 
we used three dimensionality reduction techniques: PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP. PCA provided 
a linear perspective, simplifying variance capture, while t-SNE highlighted local 
relationships between data points. However, UMAP proved most effective, offering a clearer global and 
local structure for better clustering and categorization, enhancing the understanding of coal quality variations.
